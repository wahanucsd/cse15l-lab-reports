1.Installing VScode
 


I installed VScode before the lab. I downloaded the VScode installer and then installed it. 
 
 
2.Remotely Connecting








I changed the password for three times. I spend almost 24 hours to login. 
All of us saw “You are using 0% CPU on this system.”. 
However, all of us have different number in “Time”, “Users”, “Load”, and “Average”.





3.Trying Some Commands




The “cd <path>ls” command could change the working directory. The “<path>” is the place where the file and folder in filesystem. 
I used these commands: cd ~, cd, ls -lat, ls -a, ls <directory> according to the instructions.






4.Moving Files with scp


First I created a file and added some code. Then, I entered “scp WhereAmI.java cs15lfa22dm@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/”using my computer terminal. 
Then I used these commands: “javac WhereAmI.java” and “java WhereAmI”. Then I tried to use these commands in the remote terminal.

I spend one minute and thirty-one seconds doing these things. 
I think that copying and running the file for 100 times need about several minutes, maybe 15 minutes.

 
5. Setting an SSH Key


First, I used the command “ssh-keygen”. 
Then I entered “/Users/wanjinghan/.ssh/id_rsa” for savingthe key. 
After this, I pressed “return” for several times. 
After this, I used “ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu”, “mkdir .ssh”, 
and “scp Users/wanjinghan/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lfa22dm@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys” to check whether I need password to login. 
After checking, I found that I don’tn need to use password to login. 
I found that I only use fifty one seconds to do the experiment. I saved about forty seconds




6. Optimizing Remote Running



First, I changed the code in the file. 
After that, I used three commands: “cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java”, “javac OtherMain.java” and “java WhereAmI”. 
However, I found that I could use one command to run all of these commands: “cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI”. 
This could save time for use. After this, my friend told me that we could use up arrow counts to use the last command in the terminal. 
I think these could save a lot of time and work for use.
